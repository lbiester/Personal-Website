  I am a second-year PhD Student at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), where I work with Dr. Rada Mihalcea on natural language processing and computational social science. I am interested in gaining a better understanding of people through language data and AI for social good.

  After completing my PhD, I hope to stay in academia as a faculty member.

  Before I was a graduate student, I spent two years at Pinterest as a software engineer, and earned my BA in computer science from Carleton College in 2016.
