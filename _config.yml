  I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/cs) at [Middlebury College](https://www.middlebury.edu/). I am teaching Introduction to Computing (CSCI 0145) in Fall 2023.

  My research interests are at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Social Science. My Ph.D. thesis focused on modeling change in language over time for individuals with depression, primarily using social media data. I have also done work on perspectivism in NLP, bias in language, and Clinical NLP.

  I completed my Ph.D. in 2023 at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), and earned my B.A. in computer science from [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/) in 2016. I have also spent time in industry, including a summer as an intern [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/) working on Clinical NLP and two years as a full-time software engineer at [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) working on database systems.
