  I am a final-year PhD student at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), where I work with [Dr. Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/) on natural language processing and computational social science. I am interested in gaining a better understanding of people through language data and AI for social good. 
  
  In addition to NLP, I am interested in teaching. At Michigan, I have taught Discover Computer Science and Elementary Programming Concepts as the instructor of record. I have also taught NLP and supervised research projects at [Carleton College's Summer Liberal Arts Institute](https://www.carleton.edu/summer/pre-college/programs/cs/), which provides high school students with an opportunity to experience college-level academics. After completing my PhD, I hope to stay in academia as a faculty member.

  During the Summer of 2021, I was an intern at [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/) working on Clinical NLP. Before I was a graduate student, I spent two years at [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) as a software engineer, and earned my BA in computer science from [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/) in 2016.
